    title: Introduction to Prisoner's Dilemma
---

Prisoner’s dilemma (here on abbreviated as P.D) is an extensively studied game with extremely simple rules of play- Two players have an independent choice of making a move from the given option of two- Cooperate (abbreviated ’C’) and Defect (abbreviated ’D’). From these choices, come the results of the game:-

1. If both play C, both earn 3 points.

2. If both play D, both earn 1 point.

3. If one plays D and other C, the former earns 5 points and latter earns 0.

Given below is the payoff matrix of PD graphically -
