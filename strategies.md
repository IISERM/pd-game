A ‘move’ refers to the choice made in a round of the PD game. Ours is an Iterated PD game wherein we have multiple rounds of the game - meaning the players get to move more than once. The points per round are summed for the final result.

A ‘strategy’ is what will really play the game and what the participants need to devise. It is a set of rules that will define how to choose the moves for every round of a match. So, instead of two people sitting on the computers thinking of what move to select for multiple rounds, they simply send in pre-formed strategies that substitute in their place in the game.

The next section explains how to make strategies for this game. Section 4 would go on and explain the rules for participation and sending in your strategy, while Section 5 will give example strategies for a clearer understanding.
