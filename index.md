##Welcome to The Prisoners Dilemma Game - The IISER Mohali version.

Brainchild of Kartikey Awasthi(MS18204) who seems to have made it his life goal to spread the gospel of Evolutionary Game Theory, this game is a  tournament to find the best strategy that you guys can come up with. But since Biology is so _eh_, we're just going to be doing normal Game Theory.

As with all events, No PrEviOuS KnoWleDge of the topic is necessary. Go through the Official Guidebook and FAQs to understand what the hell GT is, and also to understand the rules of the game.

Also the organiser was lazy and hasn't provided any links to learn about GT. But everyone has Google.

Stay healthy, stay safe and don't go out unless you have a strategy.
